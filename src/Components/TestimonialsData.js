Guru has vast and broad technical experience, yes. However I believe his great interpersonal skills and a superb capacity for empathy result in his ability to motivate the team to care about its projects and the projectâ€™s success. He took it upon himself to be the go-to person for interacting with the programmer offsite team, and provided tireless effort, positive attitude and respect for others to achieve great results with that team, which included very successful software deliveries, as well as cost-saving and innovative process improvements.
